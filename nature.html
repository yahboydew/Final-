    <p>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer.
        That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. I hear the jury's still out on
        science. No… but I'd like to be asked! First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.

        Whoa, this guy's straight? No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I'm a monster. But I
        bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?

        I hear the jury's still out on science.
        I care deeply for nature. Across from where? Michael! Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Marry me.

        I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.
        He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.

        I've opened a door here that I regret. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' We just call it a sausage. There's
        so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing
        smelling like fish.

        I'm half machine. I'm a monster.
        We just call it a sausage.
        Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.
        Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. We just call it a sausage. Really? Did nothing cancel? Bad news. Andy
        Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. That's why you always leave a note!

        No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an
        honest man with no secrets to hide. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have
        more fun.

        He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. He'll want to use your yacht, and
        I don't want this thing smelling like fish. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"

        There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a
        television actor. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.

        No… but I'd like to be asked! There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray.
