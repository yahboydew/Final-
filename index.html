    <p>My name is Drew Wellman. In my free time I like to play video games and listen to music. Most of the time I can be found listening to Hip Hop or Rock, however sometimes I do enjoy a little bluegrass. On the video game side of the spectrum I enjoy mainly single player games like Dark Souls and Metal Gear Solid games.  </p>
